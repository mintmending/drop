# Drop Website
This is a website for the Guild Wars 2 Static Group "Downstate is a Lifestyle \[Drop\]": https://mintmending.github.io/drop/ .

## Home
Providing a landing page for the website. Place for static specific announcements and general GW2 news from the official source.

## Leaderboard
The leaderboard page gives an overview of our best dps and boon dps builds and how close we get to the current benchmarks (in %) with them. You can inspect the corresponding logs by clicking on the log-icon.

Links to our dps.report-logs and current benchmarks from the snowcrows website are stored in two seperate Google Sheets and fetched via api. Using the provided api from dps.report, stats on build and damage are fetched and compared to current benchmarks. Important stats like account name, build, damage, percentage of current benchmark and a link to the corresponding log are displayed in the leaderboard tables.

## Raid Food
Planned feature.
Perhaps embed Google Sheets table for who donated food/gold for the month already.

## Fashion Wars
Planned feature.
Perhaps add a gallery for screenshots of transmogs.

## de-en Language
Planned feature.
Add the possibility to change website language between german and english (while providing external GW2 News in the corresponding language).

## Login
Planned feature.
Later add a backend and authentication to allow for saving data on a server and providing the possibility for authenticated users to upload logs directly (instead of saving them in a Google Sheet).
